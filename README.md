# Most-LikelyHood-Estimator-for-bi-grams
The primary concept of the estimator involves determining the likelihood of two consecutive words appearing together. 
In other words, it aims to calculate the probability of the second word occurring after the first word is given.

Bigrams are pairs of consecutive words in a text or sequence. 

The Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) is a statistical method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution.

It aims to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of observing the given data. In the context of bigrams,
the MLE can be used to estimate the probability of observing a particular second word given a first word.

This involves calculating the frequency of each bigram in a corpus of text and dividing it by the total frequency of the first word to get the conditional probability of the second word given the first word.
